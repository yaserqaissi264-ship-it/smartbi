## Features

### Tab 1: Product Associations
Discover which products are frequently purchased together.

**Key Metrics:**
- **Co-occurrence**: How many times products were bought together
- **Support**: Percentage of transactions containing both products
- **Confidence A竊達**: When customers buy A, how often they buy B
- **Confidence B竊但**: When customers buy B, how often they buy A
- **Lift**: How much more likely products are bought together vs. independently

**How to Use:**
1. Select the **Items** column (contains product names)
2. Set the **Product Separator** (usually `+` or `,`)
3. Adjust **Min Support (%)**: Higher values = stronger associations only
4. Click **Analyze Associations**

**Expected Output:**
- Association rules table with top product pairs
- Interactive network graph showing product relationships
- Frequency analysis of individual products
- Strength ranking of associations

**Business Applications:**
- Create product bundles (e.g., "Gaming Setup Bundle")

- Spending patterns by customer status

**Key Insights:**
- Which payment methods are most popular

- Age groups with highest spending

### Tab 4: Category Analysis
Understand product category performance.

**Metrics:**
- Number of transactions per category
- Revenue contribution by category
- Average price per category
- Min/Max transaction values

**Visualizations:**
- Transaction count by category
- Revenue by category
- Detailed performance metrics table

**Business Applications:**

- Optimize category-level discounts
- Plan inventory based on category demand

### Tab 5: Time Analysis
Discover temporal patterns in purchases.

**Analysis:**
- Transactions by day of week
- Revenue by day of week
- Peak shopping days
- Seasonal patterns

**Business Applications:**
- Optimize staff scheduling
- Plan promotional campaigns for high-traffic days
- Adjust inventory for peak periods

## Understanding Market Basket Metrics

### Support
**Formula:** (Number of transactions with both A and B) / (Total transactions)

**Interpretation:** 
- 5% support means the product pair appears together in 5% of all transactions
- Higher support = stronger, more reliable association

**Example:** If RTX 4090 and Thermal Paste appear together 50 times in 1000 transactions = 5% support

### Confidence (A竊達)
**Formula:** (Times A and B bought together) / (Times A is bought)

**Interpretation:**
- 60% confidence means when someone buys A, they buy B 60% of the time
- Useful for predicting what customers will buy next

**Example:** If RTX 4090 is bought 100 times and with Thermal Paste 60 times = 60% confidence

### Lift
**Formula:** (Confidence A竊達) / (Support of B)

**Interpretation:**
- Lift > 1: A and B are positively correlated (bought together more than expected by chance)
- Lift = 1: A and B are independent
- Lift < 1: A and B are negatively correlated

**Example:** 
- Lift of 2.5 = buying A makes you 2.5x more likely to buy B
- Lift of 0.8 = buying A makes you less likely to buy B

## Practical Examples

### Example 1: Finding Bundle Opportunities

Your data shows:
- RTX 4090 + Thermal Paste: Co-occurrence = 45, Support = 7%, Confidence = 85%, Lift = 3.2

**Interpretation:**
- 45 customers bought both products
- 7% of all customers who buy one buy the other
- 85% of RTX 4090 buyers also buy Thermal Paste
- Buying RTX 4090 makes you 3.2x more likely to buy Thermal Paste

**Action:** Create a "RTX 4090 Care Bundle" with 10-15% discount

### Example 2: Cross-Sell Optimization

Data shows Gaming Chair + RGB Keyboard pair:
- Support = 12%, Confidence A竊達 = 75%, Lift = 4.1

**Action:** When customers add Gaming Chair to cart, suggest RGB Keyboard

### Example 3: Payment Method Insights

Analysis shows:
- Debit Card users spend 20% more on average
- Credit Card is most popular (45% of transactions)
- Cash users tend to buy fewer items per transaction

**Action:** Encourage credit card payments with loyalty points, target cash users for bulk discounts

## Tips for Best Results

### 1. Data Preparation
- Ensure "Items" column has consistent delimiters
- Remove null/empty transactions
- Clean product names (consistent capitalization, spelling)

### 2. Finding Optimal Support Threshold
- Start with 5% support to see popular associations
- If too many results, increase to 10-15%
- If too few, lower to 2-3%

### 3. Interpreting Results
- Focus on associations with Lift > 1.5
- Look for actionable patterns (items you can bundle)
- Consider category diversity in bundles

### 4. Business Actions
- **High Confidence (>70%)**: Strong recommendation for bundling
- **High Lift (>2)**: Strong market basket opportunity
- **High Support (>10%)**: Reliable pattern worth acting on

## Advanced Analysis

### Product Triplets
The system also identifies three-product combinations:
- Look for "triple plays" that often sell together
- Example: Gaming Monitor + Gaming Chair + Gaming Keyboard

### Correlation Analysis
Go to **沒 Data Analysis** tab for:
- Correlation between spending amount and customer characteristics
- Correlation between payment method and product category
- Age-based purchase pattern analysis

### RFM Analysis
(Available in Dashboard - **沒 Dashboard**)
- **Recency**: How recently did customer buy?
- **Frequency**: How often do they purchase?
- **Monetary**: How much do they spend?

## Exporting Results

All tabs support data export:
- Click **沒･ Download CSV** button
- Save association rules for further analysis
- Import into Excel for presentations

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "No associations found"
**Solution:** 
- Lower the minimum support threshold
- Ensure Items column uses correct delimiter
- Check that you have enough transactions (>50 recommended)

### Issue: Too many associations shown
**Solution:**
- Increase minimum support threshold
- Focus on associations with high lift values
- Sort by confidence to find strongest patterns

### Issue: Product names look wrong
**Solution:**
- Check the delimiter matches your data
- Products may need cleaning (trim spaces)
- Use the Data Cleaning tab first

## Integration with Other Features

1. **Data Cleaning** (洫ｹ): Clean product names before analysis
2. **Feature Engineering** (沐ｧ): Create customer segments for targeted analysis
3. **Dashboard** (沒): Monitor KPIs from market basket insights
4. **Forecasting** (沐ｮ): Predict future demand for bundled products

## Next Steps

1. **Upload your complete POS dataset** (all transactions)
2. **Run market basket analysis** to identify top opportunities
3. **Create bundles** based on high-lift associations
4. **Monitor performance** of bundled products
5. **Adjust and refine** based on sales data
